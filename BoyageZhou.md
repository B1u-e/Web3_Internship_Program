## Self-introduction

Hey! I’m an ENTP/J-A navigating the Web3 world with curiosity and an open mind. I co-founded a crypto project back in my freshman year when I barely knew anything about the space — but the more I explored, the more hooked I became. I love learning by doing, adapting fast, and diving headfirst into new ideas. Outside the digital world, I’m big on outdoor sports, adventures, and theatre. Currently studying in the U.S., always looking to connect with other builders and thinkers in the space.
